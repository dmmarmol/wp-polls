Requires at least: 3.9  
Tested up to: 4.3  
### Development
Stable tag: 2.70  

This plugin is based on the "WP-Polls" plugin made by GamerZ with the main difference that i've removed all the provided CSS files and added a little of extra HTML markup to make it easier for the Developer and the designer for applying custom style.<a href=""></a>
If you want to use your own CSS styles, you just have to create a file called `polls-css.css` inside a folder called `css/` on your `theme directory`. If it doesn't exist, it will look to the same file on your `theme directory` AND if it doesn't exist, it will try to load it from your plugin folder `wp-polls/`.

> Adds an AJAX poll system to your WordPress blog. You can also easily add a poll into your WordPress's blog post/page.
